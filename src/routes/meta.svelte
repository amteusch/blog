		This is mostly meant as a portfolio website that also houses some of my thoughts in the form of blog posts.
		Hope you enjoy!

		The current version of this website was created using <a

			title="Website of SvelteKit"
		>
			SvelteKit
		</a>
		and is heavily based on <a href="https://github.com/kevtiq/crinkle.dev" title="Crinkle repo">open source</a> 
		code from <a href="https://crinkle.dev/" title="Kevin's website">Kevin Pennekamp</a> (with a few tweaks of my own). 
		Thanks Kevin!
