Link to exceptions in CUBE CSS, but why it is part of 'blocks' in my opinion.

## HTML `data-` attribute

- Easy: button type (equals)
- Harder: first row/column grid (uses different operators), start/end of stretching element
- Perfect use case: state machines

```css
.myClass[data-state~='test'] {
}
```
